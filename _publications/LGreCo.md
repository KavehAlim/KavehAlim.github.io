title: "L-GreCo: A Framework for Layerwise Adaptive Gradient Compression"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/GreCo
excerpt: 'In this paper, we addressed optimal gradient compression in distributed training of neural networks. Our proposed algorithm, called L-GreCo, uses dynamic programming to find the optimal layer-wise compression. L-GreCo preserves the model accuracy while providing training-time speed-ups under different compression schemes on multiple tasks and architectures.'
