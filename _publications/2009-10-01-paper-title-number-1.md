In This work, we proved new upper bounds and lower bounds for communication over a noisy channel in the presence of a malicious jamming adversary. Our lower bound improves upon the generalized Gilbert-Varshamov bound for general arbitrarily varying channels (AVCs) while the upper bound generalizes the well known Elias-Bassalygo bound (known for binary and q-ary alphabets).
