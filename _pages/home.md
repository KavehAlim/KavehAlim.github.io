I'm a bachelor student studying Electrical Engineering and Mathematics (Double Major) at Sharif University of Technology. I am currently a scientific intern at IST Austria where I have the great pleasure to work with [Professor Dan Alistarh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh/) on gradient compression and weight compression of neural networks. Prior to that, I worked on adversarial communication channels under the supervision of [Professor Sidharth Jaggi](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi).

Research Interest
======
I am generally curious about the intersection of machine learning, information theory, statistics, and optimization. My main areas of interest include:
- Distributed Machine Learning
- Neural Networks' Training and Inference Acceleration
- Privacy and Fairness
- High Dimensional Statistics

I have worked on:
- Neural Networks' Training and Inference Acceleration
- Communication Channels in the Presence of Myopic Adversaries.
- Privacy and Communication Chalenges in Federated Learning.
