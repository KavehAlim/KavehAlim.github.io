I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu/) at MIT and a student member of [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). Before coming to MIT, I earned a dual B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology.

My research interests lie in the span of machine learning, information theory, statistics, optimization, and privacy.

During my undergrad, I was very fortunate to work with [Professor Dan Alistarh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh/), [Professor Sidharth Jaggi](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi), and [Professor Mohammad Hossein Yassaee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y6vuiBUAAAAJ&hl=en).
