I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu/) at MIT and a student member of [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). Before coming to MIT, I earned a dual B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology. During my undergrad, I was very fortunate to work with [Professor Dan Alistarh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh/), [Professor Sidharth Jaggi](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi), and [Professor Mohammad Hossein Yassaee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y6vuiBUAAAAJ&hl=en).

Research Interest
======
I am generally curious about the intersection of machine learning, information theory, statistics, and optimization.

<!-- My main areas of interest include the following:
- Distributed Machine Learning
- Neural Networks' Training and Inference Acceleration
- Privacy
- High Dimensional Statistics

I have worked on:
- Neural Networks' Training and Inference Acceleration
- Communication Channels in the Presence of Myopic Adversaries.
- Privacy and Communication Challenges in Federated Learning. -->
